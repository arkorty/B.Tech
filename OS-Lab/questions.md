1. Program assignment using basic linux commands (cd, pwd, mkdir, ls, cp, mv, wc etc.), meta characters, grep commands, regular expression parameters, modifying file access privileges and string manipulation.

2. WAP to implement FCFS, preemptive and non- preemptive SJF, Round Robin, preemptive and non- preemptive Priority scheduling algorithm (in programming language of your choice).

3. Create a program with two threads that increment and decrement a shared variable using semaphores to ensure proper synchronization.

4. Implement a solution to the classic producer-consumer problem using semaphores.
