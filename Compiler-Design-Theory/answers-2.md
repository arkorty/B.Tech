This file contains questions that were skipped because they were incomplete due to OCR errors, primarily referencing missing images, diagrams, or tables.

- **PCCST601 0000191:** Consider the following grammar and LR(1) automaton. Construct the CLR parsing table.
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The grammar and the LR(1) automaton are missing as they were described as being "shown in the image".

- **PCCST601 0000207:** Consider the following grammar and complete the closure sets in the following SLR automaton.
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The SLR automaton to be completed is missing.

- **PCCST601 0000208:** Consider the following LR(0) automaton and parse the following string: **id \* id + id**. Show Stack, grammar symbols corresponding to the states, input and action entries.
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The LR(0) automaton is missing.

- **PCCST601 0000212:** Consider the following augmented grammar and SLR automaton. Construct the SLR parsing table.
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The SLR automaton is missing.

- **PCCST601 0000220:** Construct the LALR(1) parsing table from the following CLR parsing table. Justify the reason behind merging every pair of states.
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The CLR parsing table to be converted is missing.

- **PCCST601 0000221:** Convert the following NFA to an equivalent DFA: (NFA transition table is provided)
    * **Reason for Skipping:** The NFA transition table is missing.
