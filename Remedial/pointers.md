### Basic Concept of a Pointer:

```c
int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var; // ptr holds the address of var
```

- `var` is a variable of type `int` that holds the value `10`.
- `ptr` is a pointer to an integer. It holds the **memory address** of `var`, not its actual value.

### Memory Representation:

Assume `var` is stored at memory address `1004`.

```
Memory Address | Value
---------------|------
     1004      |  10    <-- var
     2000      | 1004   <-- ptr (pointer to var)
```

- `var` is located at address `1004`, and it stores the value `10`.
- `ptr` is a pointer, stored at address `2000`, and its value is the address of `var` (`1004`).

### Dereferencing a Pointer:

When you "dereference" a pointer using the `*` operator, you access the value stored at the address the pointer holds.

```c
printf("%d", *ptr); // Prints 10
```

ASCII diagram after dereferencing:

```
ptr (at 2000) -> 1004 (var) -> 10 (value)
```

- `*ptr` accesses the value at address `1004`, which is `10`.

### Pointer with Dynamic Memory Allocation:

Using `malloc`, you can dynamically allocate memory and use pointers to access and manipulate it.

```c
int *ptr2 = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory
*ptr2 = 20;                      // Store 20 in allocated memory
```

Letâ€™s assume `malloc` returns address `3000`.

```
Memory Address | Value
---------------|------
     1004      |  10   <-- var
     2000      | 1004  <-- ptr (pointer to var)
     3000      |  20   <-- dynamically allocated memory (*ptr2)
     4000      | 3000  <-- ptr2 (points to dynamic memory)
```

- `ptr2` is a pointer that points to dynamically allocated memory at address `3000`.
- Dereferencing `ptr2` gives the value `20`.

### Pointer to Pointer:

You can also have pointers to pointers, which store the address of another pointer.

```c
int **ptr_to_ptr = &ptr; // Pointer to pointer
```

Assuming `ptr_to_ptr` is stored at address `5000`:

```
Memory Address | Value
---------------|------
     1004      |  10   <-- var
     2000      | 1004  <-- ptr (pointer to var)
     3000      |  20   <-- dynamically allocated memory (*ptr2)
     4000      | 3000  <-- ptr2 (points to dynamic memory)
     5000      | 2000  <-- ptr_to_ptr (points to ptr)
```

### Diagram Explanation:

- `ptr_to_ptr` stores the address of `ptr` (`2000`).
- To access `var` via `ptr_to_ptr`, you dereference twice: `**ptr_to_ptr = 10`.

The overall structure looks like this:

```
ptr_to_ptr (at 5000) -> ptr (at 2000) -> var (at 1004) -> 10
```

This is a brief introduction to pointers and how memory looks in C11 with the use of pointers, using ASCII diagrams to visualize memory addresses and relationships.
